Does privacy matters? You may thing that you have nothing to hide. Like most of us, you are not engaging in criminal activities online. But how would you feel if someone followed you around, everyday, taking notes about what you buy, what you read, what you tell your friends about that weird new colleague, ect ? In this guide, we'll review how you are tracked online and what you can do about it.

But first, let cite Glenn Greenwald, a journalist that worked with Edward Snowden, from a [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters) he gave in October 2014: "Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." Not a single person has taken me up on that offer."
